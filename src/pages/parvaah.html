            The social initiative of K.J. Somaiya College of engineering, named
            Parvaah, works each year with a purpose of providing to the
            underprivileged and oppressed. This time around, Parvaah is on a
            mission to establish a “Zero Waste Community,” wherein constant
            efforts are being made for reducing, reusing and recycling the waste
            generated and contributing back to the society.

            It is said ‘The students of today are the future of tomorrow’.
            Realising this, Parvaah plans on visiting schools in Mumbai and
            teach the students the basic principles of a zero waste community.
            It’s an attempt to educate the students as well as the staff of the
            school about the need to go zero waste. Along with this, we also aim
            at transforming the schools into a zero waste locality. Instilling a
            sense of responsibility in the students towards managing their waste
            will go a long way in realising our goal of a cleaner Mumbai.
